GEODJANGO INTERVIEW.

An NGO has 13 offices distributed all over Kenya, of these offices:
	9 offices report to 3 regional offices (3 field offices report to 1 regional office).
	The 3 regional offices report to the head office in Nairobi.
	Information shared include:
		the area of coverage of each field office,
		physical features,
		the number of staff within an office and
		issues the office is  addressing in the area (e.g water, errosion, education, health).
	Basically,
		the regional office is made up of a collection of 3 field offices
		the head office brings together the regional offices. 


A) Build a location based application with the view of the head office
	i.e showing all the regional offices (location, issues and number of staff) and
	field offices (location and number of staff).
	(use geodjango and postgresql with any other tool of your choice (e.g leaflet library, reactjs, shape files etc)).
B) Make the system interactive (visible boundaries and onclick markers events to show more information).


Please note: We are looking for a demonstration of knowledge in the technologies mentioned (geodjango and postgresql).
Considerations will be based on your creativity and skill level.


All the best.
